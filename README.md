# Extended-Connect-4
An extended version of the classic
Connect 4 game, with a 9 x 7 board and a requirement of 5 in
a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. The game
will always start with player X and alternate between players X
and O(who will play on the same computer). During each
turn, the game will show the players the current board, ask the
appropriate player to select a column to add their token to,
and then check to see if that results in a tie game or a win. If it
results in a win, it will inform the players who won, show them
the winning board, and ask if they want to play again. If it
results in a tie, it will inform the players, show the game board,
and ask if they want to play again. The program will move on
to the next player's turn if it is neither a tie nor a win.
